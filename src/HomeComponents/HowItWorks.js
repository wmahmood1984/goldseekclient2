            <h1>How it Works?</h1>
            <p>The Seek BNB Smart Contract is modeled after an proven smart contract code that has been in existence since 2017. The leading contracts based on this model have held and distributed millions of dollars to members across the globe and continue to do so to this day. The concept is simple.</p>
            <div style={{border:'solid green 1px', margin:'10px 50px'}}>
                <p>Users join the community by purchasing platform credits called "Seek BNB".There is a buy price and a sell price for Seek BNB that fluctuates based upon activity of community members.</p><br/>
                <p>There is a 10% fee debited when users purchase Seek BNB.These fees are distributed to all Seek Coin Holders as dividends upon each purchase, INCLUDING the person who made the purchase!</p><br/>
                <p>There is a 7% fee when people sell Seek BNB Credits. This fee is also split and sent as dividends to all Seek BNB Credit Holders.</p><br/>
                <p>Users can SELL all or a portion of their credits anytime they choose.After they sell they can instantly withdraw to their Metamask Walletand the funds are deposited at the real time Ethereum value of their credits instantly!</p><br/>            
            </div>

            <div style={{border:'solid green 1px', margin:'10px 50px'}}>
                <h3>Smart Members will hold their credits in the system for as long as possible to benefit from the following</h3><br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Appreciation in value of their credits. As activity happens the sell credit price will fast become MORE than the buy price a person paid for the credits.This can allow users to multiply their credits by 2, 3 or even 100X or more!</li>
                    <li>As mebers hold their funds in the contract they still benefit from the increase in value of Ethereum. As Ethereum goes up in price so does the value of all the credits they have in the system when they exchange credits back to Ethereum!</li>
                    <li>Consistent Real Time Dividends that will accumulate and can be withdrawn at anytime! This can provide an increase in value of zero to 3% or more per day 7 days per week asactivity happens in the smart contract day after day year after year!</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>When you refer a new member and they buy credits you are rewarded with a 7% instant commission! This fee is a reward from the platform and does NOT come from the users purchase!</li>
                    <li>When someone you refer refers someone this is considered an indirect commission. The person who made the referral gets paid 7% commission and YOU get paid a 3% indirect commission!</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <p>Commissions can be withdrawn instantly and there is NO Fee charged on commission withdraws!</p><br/>
                <p>There are no additional fees with the Seek BNB Smart Contract other than a 5% admin/developer fee on deposits.</p><br/>
